maintenance of non-leaking or leak-tight equipment. Following
initial testing after commissioning, the monitoring for leak detection
is to be carried out as a permanent on-going Leak Detection and
Repair (LDAR) programme. Finally detected leaks are to be repaired
within allowable time frame.
408 The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986
(2) Components to be Covered: Components that shall be covered under
LDAR programme include (i) Block valves; (ii) Control valves;
(iii) Pump seals; (iv) Compressor seals; (v) Pressure relief valves;
(vi) Flanges Heat Exchangers; (vii) Flanges Piping; (viii)
Connectors Piping; (ix) Open ended lines; and (x) Sampling
connections, Equipment and line sizes more than 1.875 cm or ¾ inch
are to be covered.
(3) Applicability: LDAR programme would be applicable to components
(given at 2 above) for following products/compounds: (i)
hydrocarbon gases; (ii) Light liquid with vapour pressure @ 20oC
> 1.0 kPa; and (iii) Heavy liquid with vapour pressure @ 20o C
between 0.3 to 1.0 kPa.
(4) While LDAR will not be applicable for heavy liquids with vapour
pressure < 0.3 kPa, it will be desirable to check for liquid dripping as
indication of leak.
(5) Definition of leak: A leak is defined as the detection of VOC
concentration more than the values (in ppm) specified below at the
emission source using a hydrocarbon analyzer according to
measurement protocol (US EPA 453/R-95-017, 1995 Protocol for
equipment leak emission estimates may be referred to:

(6) In addition, any component observe to be leaking by sight, sound or
smell, regardless of concentration (liquid dripping, visible vapor
leak) or presence of bubbles using soap solution should be
considered as leak.
(7) Monitoring Requirements and Repair Schedule: Following frequency
of monitoring of leaks and schedule for repair of leaks shall be
followed:

(8) The percentage leaking components should not be more than 2% for any
group of components monitored excluding pumps/compressors. In case of
pumps/compressors it should be less than 10% of the total number of
pumps/compressors or three pumps and compressors, whichever is greater.
(9) Emission inventory: Refinery shall prepare on inventory of equipment
components in the plant. After the instrumental measurement of leaks,
emission from the components will be calculated using stratified emission
factor (USEPA) or any other superior factors. The total fugitive emission
will be established.
410 The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986
(10) Monitoring following types of monitoring methods may be judiciously
employed for detection of leaks: (i) instrumental method of measurement of
leaks; (ii) Audio, visual and olfactory (AVO) leak detection; and (iii) Soap
bubble method.
(11) Data on time of measurement and concentration value for leak detection;
time of repair of leak; and time of measurement & concentration value after
repair of leak should be documented for all the components.
(12) Pressure relief and blow down systems should discharge to a vapour
collection and recovery system or to flare.
(13) Open-ended lines should be closed by a blind flange or plugged.
(14) Totally closed-loop should be used in all routine samples.
(15) Low emission packing should be used for valves.
(16) High integrity sealing materials should be used for flanges.
D. Emission Standards for VOC from Wastewater Collection and Treatment
(1) All contaminated and odorous wastewater streams shall be handled in closed
systems from the source to the primary treatment stages (oil-water separator
and equalization tanks).
(2) The collection system shall be covered with water seals (traps) on sewers and
drains and gas tight covers on junction boxes.
(3) Oil-water separators and equalization tanks shall be provided with
floating/fixed covers. The off-gas generated shall be treated to remove at least
90% of VOC and eliminate odour. The system design shall ensure safety
(prevention of formation of explosive mixture, possible detonation and
reduce the impact) by dilution with air/inert gas, installing LEL detector
including control devices, seal drums, detonation arrestors etc. The system
shall be designed and operated for safe maintenance of the collection and
primary treatment systems.
(4) Wastewater from aromatics plants (benzene and xylene plants) shall be
treated to remove benzene & total aromatics to a level of 10, 20 ppm
respectively before discharge to effluent treatment system without dilution].

metals and radionuclide concentrations. Their combined (synergistic or antagonistic) effects on health
and aquatic lives are not yet clearly known. These chemicals undergo bio-accumulation, magnification
and transfer to human and other animals through food chain. In areas where fisheries, salt pans are the
governing considerations, and presence of such chemicals apprehended/reported, bioassay test should
be performed following appropriate methods for the purpose of setting case specific limits.

In a water body or its part, water is subjected to several types of uses. Depending on the
types of uses and activities, water quality criteria have been specified to determine its
suitability for a particular purpose. Among the various types of users there is one use that
demands highest level of water quality or purity and that is termed as ""Designated Best
Use"" in that stretch of water body. Based on this, water quality requirements have been
specified for different uses in terms of primary water quality criteria. The primary water
quality criteria for bathing water are specified along with the rationale in Table 1.

waste materials as far as practicable in order to minimize the
discharge of wastes into the environments.
(3) the industries are to be encouraged for recovery of biogas, energy
and reusable materials.
(4) while permitting the discharge of effluent and emission into the
environment, State Boards have to take into account the
assimilative capacities of the receiving bodies, especially water
bodies so that quality of the intended use of the receiving waters
is not affected. Where such quality is likely to be effected
discharges should not be allowed into water bodies.
(5) the Central and State Boards shall put emphasis on the
implementation of clean technologies by the industries in order to
increase fuel efficiency and reduce the generation of
environmental pollutants.
(6) All efforts should be made to remove colour and unpleasant odour
as far as practicable.

treatment plant before dilution.
(b) Bio-assay test should be carried out with the available
species of fish in the receiving water, the COD limits to be
specified in the consent conditions should be correlated with
the BOD limits.
(c) In case metabolites and isomers of the Pesticides in the
given list are found in significant concentration, standards
should be prescribed for these also in the same
concentration as the individual pesticides.
(d) Industries are required to analyze pesticides in waste water
by advanced analytical methods such as GLC/HPLC.
(214) The chemical oxygen demands (COD) concentration in a treated
effluent, if observed to be persistently greater than 250 mg/l
before disposal to any receiving body (public sewer, land for
irrigation, inland surface water and marine coastal areas), such
industrial units are required to identify chemicals causing the
same. In case these are found to be toxic as defined in the
Schedule I of the Hazardous Rules 1989 the State Board in such
cases shall direct the industries to install tertiary treatment
stipulating time limit.
(15) Standards specified in Part A of Schedule VI for discharge of
effluent into the public sewer shall be applicable only if such sewer
leads to a secondary treatment including biological treatment
system, otherwise the discharge into sewers shall be treated as
discharge into inland surface waters].
